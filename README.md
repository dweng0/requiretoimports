# Require To Imports

Take your old files that use AMD require.

and magically ~~break them.~~ turn them into files that use es6 imports!<br/>

Now your files are ready to be slipped into a webpack driven project.

My use case
------

Have an old project that uses the old defines/require functions to pull in dependencies.
Want to upgrade this without having to go through each file manually.
